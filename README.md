# Keploy Python-SDK
This is the client SDK for the [Keploy](https://github.com/keploy/keploy) testing platform. With the Python SDK, you can test both your existing unit test cases in Pytest and create new end-to-end test cases for your applications.
The **HTTP mocks/stubs and tests are the same format** and inter-exchangeable.

## Installation
1. First you need to install [Python(version 3 and above)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Install the Python-SDK via pip.

```bash
pip install keploy
```

3. Install Keploy from [here](https://github.com/keploy/keploy?tab=readme-ov-file#-quick-installation)

## Usage
Keploy simplifies the testing process by seamlessly generating end-to-end test cases without the need to write unit test files and manage mocks/stubs.

Add a test file with the following code to the directory with all your existing tests. We can call this `test_keploy.py`

```python
from Keploy import run

def test_keploy():
    run("<command-to-run-your-application>")
```
Now to run this testcase along with your another unit testcases, you can run the command below:

```bash
keploy test -c "python3 -m coverage run -m pytest test_keploy.py <other-unit-test-files>" --delay 10 --coverage
```

HoorayðŸŽ‰! You've sucessfully got the coverage of your Keploy recorded api tests using Pytest.
